Nodeboard is MEVN (Mongo, Express, Vue, Node) stack project that is designed to
support and host the play (and development) of multiplayer boardgames. The application
is still under construction and is entirely a labour of love.

If you'd like to help, get in touch!

```bash
# To host and run locally:
npm run dev

# To build for production:
npm run build

# To start the production server
npm start

# To run test suite
npm test
```
